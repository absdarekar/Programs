Example Of Logical Error....,
In a Java programming, the instruction is given as,
for(a=1;a<=10;a=a+2),
System.out.println(a);
The output of the program is all odd numbers between 1 to ten,
But, the user wants to print all even numbers between 1 to ten,
Thus it should be,
for(a=2;a<=10;a=a+2), to give the desired result.
