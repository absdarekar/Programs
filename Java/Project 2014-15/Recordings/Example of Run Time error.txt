Example Of Run Time Error.,
The expression a=b+c/d,
If the value of d=0, then the result will come to an infinite, which is a run time error.
The expression a=Math.sqrt(a),  
If the value of a= minus1, then the result will come NaN, as square root of negative numbers is not defined. Hence, it is a run time error. The expression a=A.nextInt(),
 is to accept a Integer value from the console, but if the console gives input such as decimal number, character ,or string the compiler will show run time error.
